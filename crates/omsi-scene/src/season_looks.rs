//! The plants of a season's phase in two looks (`omsi_texture::season_mix`): which objects
//! are plants, and their copies with the other season's textures.
//!
//! OMSI's season folders hold per texture file whatever the content's author painted for
//! the season: the trees' foliage in `Fall` and `Spring`, bare crowns in `Winter`, but
//! also snow on a roof in `WinterSnow` or, rarely, a building's own winter picture. Only
//! plants mix: a `[tree]` (its card's picture) and an object filed as a plant - the same
//! test the windy trees use (`vegetation_give_of`: its `[groups]`, else the words of its
//! file's name), and of those only the ones with a texture that differs between the two
//! looks. Houses, roads and everything else show the look that prevails.
